How to Design a Hashset in Python?

A HashSet is a fundamental data structure in programming, commonly found in languages such as Java. 
It belongs to the Java Collections Framework and serves as an implementation of the set interface. 
The distinctive feature of a HashSet is its ability to store elements in a way that facilitates efficient checking 
for the existence of specific elements and ensures uniqueness within the set.
Unlike structures such as lists, a HashSet does not maintain any specific order among its elements.

One key characteristic of a HashSet is its guarantee of uniqueness;
 it does not allow duplicate elements. 
 Operations like adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements typically have constant-time average performance, 
 making it an efficient choice for such tasks. 
 However, it's essential to note that the order of elements in a HashSet is not guaranteed.

Key Characteristics:
Uniqueness: A HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. It uses the equals() method to check for duplicates, ensuring that every element in the set is unique.


No Order: The elements in a HashSet are not stored in any particular order. If you need to maintain the order of elements, you might consider using a LinkedHashSet, which maintains the order of insertion.

Underlying Data Structure: Internally, a HashSet uses a hash table to store elements. This allows for constant-time average complexity for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.

Null Elements: A HashSet allows one null element. If you attempt to add a duplicate null element, it will replace the existing one.
